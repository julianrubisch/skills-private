# Refactoring: Replace Subclasses with Strategies

## Context
An STI hierarchy where subclasses vary on one behavioral dimension, or where
switching a record's type requires deleting and recreating it. When subclasses
share most state but diverge in methods, composition is cleaner than inheritance.

## Before
```ruby
# STI: all types in one table, `type` column discriminates
class Question < ApplicationRecord; end

class OpenQuestion < Question
  def summary = summarize_open_answers
  def score(value) = value.length > 0 ? 1 : 0
end

class MultipleChoiceQuestion < Question
  def summary = summarize_multiple_choice_answers
  def score(value) = choices.index(value)
end
```

## After
```ruby
# Question owns persistence; strategy owns behavior
class Question < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :submittable, polymorphic: true
  delegate :summary, :score, to: :submittable
end

class OpenSubmittable < ApplicationRecord
  def summary = summarize_open_answers
  def score(value) = value.length > 0 ? 1 : 0
end

class MultipleChoiceSubmittable < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :choices
  def summary = summarize_multiple_choice_answers
  def score(value) = choices.index(value)
end
```

## Why
Type switches without deleting the question record — just swap the `submittable`
association. Strategy-specific state lives on dedicated tables (no nullable columns).
Composition is easier to test than STI.

## When NOT to apply
- Strategies have no state — a plain Ruby strategy object (no AR model) is
  enough; skip the polymorphic association.
- The hierarchy is shallow (2 types) and stable — STI overhead may not be worth
  the composition complexity.
- "Before performing a large change like this, try to imagine what currently
  difficult changes will be easier to make in the new version." — Ruby Science
