# Preferred Design Patterns

Your opinionated design toolkit. Each entry answers: what is it, when to reach for it,
and how you like it structured. Review agents use this as the "fix" vocabulary —
anti-patterns and smells point here for solutions.

## Query Objects

Encapsulate complex or reusable AR queries. Reach for this when a scope isn't enough
— multiple conditions, joins, subqueries, or shared across contexts.

```ruby
# app/queries/overdue_invoices_query.rb
class OverdueInvoicesQuery
  def initialize(relation = Invoice.all)
    @relation = relation
  end

  def call
    @relation
      .where("due_date < ?", Date.today)
      .where(paid: false)
      .order(:due_date)
  end
end

# Usage
OverdueInvoicesQuery.new.call
OverdueInvoicesQuery.new(current_user.invoices).call
```

**When:** inline `.where` chains repeated in 2+ places, or query has 3+ conditions.
**When not:** a simple named scope covers it.

## Value Objects

Represent a domain concept with no identity — **fungible** objects whose equality
is based entirely on their attributes, not an id. Two `Color.new(255, 0, 0)`
instances are the same color. Small, immutable, and replaceable.
Reach for this when you see data clumps or primitive obsession.

```ruby
# app/models/color.rb — value object with equality, conversions, comparability
class Color
  include Comparable
  include ActiveModel::Validations

  attr_reader :red, :green, :blue, :alpha

  validates :red, :green, :blue, inclusion: { in: 0..255 }
  validates :alpha, inclusion: { in: 0.0..1.0 }

  def initialize(red_or_hex, green = nil, blue = nil, alpha = 1.0)
    case [red_or_hex, green, blue]
    in [/\A#?[0-9A-Fa-f]{6}\z/ => hex, nil, nil]
      @red, @green, @blue = [hex.delete("#")].pack("H*").unpack("C*")
    else
      @red, @green, @blue = red_or_hex.to_i, green.to_i, blue.to_i
    end
    @alpha = alpha.to_f
  end

  def ==(other)
    other.is_a?(Color) && hash == other.hash
  end

  def hash
    [red, green, blue, alpha].hash
  end

  def <=>(other)
    lightness <=> other.lightness
  end

  def to_hex = format("%02X%02X%02X", red, green, blue)
  def to_rgb_s = "rgb(#{red} #{green} #{blue})"
end
```

### Integrating with ActiveRecord via `composed_of`

`composed_of` is a built-in Rails macro that maps denormalized columns to a
value object — think of it as an inline `has_one` without a separate table.

```ruby
class Theme < ApplicationRecord
  composed_of :primary_color,
              class_name: "Color",
              mapping: {
                primary_color_red: :red,
                primary_color_green: :green,
                primary_color_blue: :blue,
                primary_color_alpha: :alpha
              },
              converter: ->(value) { Color.new(value) }

  validates_associated :primary_color
end

# Now you get clean assignment, querying, and form integration:
theme = Theme.create!(name: "Dark", primary_color: "#FF0000")
theme.primary_color.to_hex          # => "FF0000"
theme.update!(primary_color: "#00FF00")
Theme.where(primary_color: Color.new("#0000FF"))
```

**Key options:**
- `mapping:` — column-to-attribute hash. **Order matters** — it determines
  constructor argument order.
- `converter:` — proc called on assignment so you can write `= "#FF0000"`
  instead of `= Color.new("#FF0000")`.
- `allow_nil:` — permits setting the value object to nil (all columns → NULL).

**When:** same 2-3 primitive values always travel together, or you find yourself
duplicating formatting/comparison logic for raw primitives. Especially when the
values are denormalized columns on a single table.
**When not:** the concept has its own identity (needs its own table → use a model).

## Form Objects

Handle multi-model forms, virtual attributes, or complex input validation outside
the model. Keeps models clean of presentation-driven concerns. A form object
models user interaction, not domain entities — it's an application-layer boundary.

Typical signals that a form object is needed:
- `before|after_create|update` hooks with side effects on the model
- Conditional validation based on UI flow state
- Transient attributes (`should_send_welcome_email`) without database backing
- A model reaching out to mutate other models from within its own logic

### ApplicationForm Base Class

Extract common form plumbing into a base class:

```ruby
# app/forms/application_form.rb
class ApplicationForm
  include ActiveModel::Model
  include ActiveModel::Attributes
  extend ActiveModel::Callbacks

  define_model_callbacks :save, only: :after

  class << self
    def after_save(...)
      set_callback(:save, :after, ...)
    end

    # Quack like ActiveRecord for route helpers and form_with
    def model_name
      ActiveModel::Name.new(self, nil, name.sub(/Form$/, ""))
    end
  end

  # Behaves like ActiveRecord: returns false on invalid, wraps in transaction
  def save
    return false unless valid?

    with_transaction { run_callbacks(:save) { submit! } }
  end

  private

  def with_transaction(&)
    ApplicationRecord.transaction(&)
  end

  # Subclasses must implement — the actual persistence logic
  def submit!
    raise NotImplementedError
  end
end
```

### Concrete Form Object

```ruby
# app/forms/contact_form.rb
class ContactForm < ApplicationForm
  attribute :name, :string
  attribute :email, :string
  attribute :should_send_welcome_email, :boolean, default: false
  attribute :follow_up, :boolean, default: false

  validates :name, presence: true, if: :follow_up
  validates :email, presence: true
  validate :contact_is_valid

  after_save :deliver_welcome_email!, if: :should_send_welcome_email

  delegate :to_param, :id, to: :contact, allow_nil: true

  def contact
    @contact ||= Contact.new(name:, email:,
      follow_up_started_at: (follow_up ? Time.current : nil))
  end

  private

  def submit!
    contact.save!
  end

  # Bubble model-level errors into the form
  def contact_is_valid
    return if contact.valid?
    errors.merge!(contact.errors)
  end

  def deliver_welcome_email!
    ContactMailer.welcome(name, email).deliver_later
  end
end
```

### Usage in Controller and View

```ruby
# Controller — same shape as a model-backed controller
class ContactsController < ApplicationController
  def new    = @contact_form = ContactForm.new
  def create
    @contact_form = ContactForm.new(contact_params)
    if @contact_form.save
      redirect_to @contact_form   # routes to /contacts/:id via model_name
    else
      render :new
    end
  end
end
```

```erb
<%# form_with routes to /contacts via model_name %>
<%= form_with model: @contact_form do |f| %>
  <%= f.text_field :name %>
  <%= f.email_field :email %>
  <%= f.check_box :should_send_welcome_email %>
<% end %>
```

**When:** form spans multiple models, has virtual fields, validation rules are
specific to one UI flow, or the model carries transient attributes / side-effect
callbacks that belong to the interaction, not the domain.
**When not:** single-model form with standard validations — just use the model.

## Rule Objects

Encapsulate complex conditional logic — sets of guard clauses that determine
whether something should happen. Better than a long `call` method with many
`return if` checks. Testable in isolation.

```ruby
# app/rules/continuation_rule.rb
class ContinuationRule
  CONVERSATION_LENGTH_MIN = 3
  LENGTH_CUTOFF = 250
  MAX_TOKENS = 8_000

  def initialize(message)
    @message = message
  end

  def satisfied?
    !sender_is_csm? &&
      onboarding_complete? &&
      conversation_long_enough? &&
      message_short_enough? &&
      within_token_limit?
  end

  private

  def sender_is_csm?       = @message.sender.csm?
  def onboarding_complete? = @message.account.onboarding_complete?
  def conversation_long_enough? = @message.conversation.messages.count >= CONVERSATION_LENGTH_MIN
  def message_short_enough? = @message.content.to_s.length <= LENGTH_CUTOFF
  def within_token_limit?  = @message.tokens_count.to_i <= MAX_TOKENS
end

# Usage
if ContinuationRule.new(message).satisfied?
  # proceed
end
```

**When:** a single method has 4+ guard clauses, or the conditions need to be
tested independently, or the same set of conditions appears in multiple places.

## Strategy Objects

Composition-based polymorphism. Instead of subclassing to vary behavior,
inject collaborator objects that implement a common interface. The host object
delegates to its strategy — behavior is pluggable at runtime.

```ruby
# Each strategy implements the same interface
class Transport::Email
  def deliver(campaign)
    campaign.addressees.find_each do |addressee|
      EmailService::Client.deliver(to: addressee, body: campaign.body)
    end
  end
end

class Transport::Sms
  def deliver(campaign)
    campaign.addressees.find_each do |addressee|
      campaign.body.chars.each_slice(SMS_CHAR_LENGTH).map(&:join).each do |chunk|
        SmsService::Client.deliver(to: addressee, body: chunk)
      end
    end
  end
end

class Output::HTML
  def format(content) = content.to_html
end

class Output::Plain
  def format(content) = content.truncate(SMS_CHAR_LENGTH)
end

# Host composes strategies — no inheritance needed
class Campaign
  attr_accessor :transport, :output
  attr_reader :body

  def initialize(transport:, output:, body:)
    @transport, @output, @body = transport, output, body
  end

  def process
    @body = output.format(@body)
    transport.deliver(self)
  end
end

# Runtime flexibility — swap strategies freely
campaign = Campaign.new(transport: Transport::Email.new, output: Output::HTML.new, body: content)
campaign.process

campaign.transport = Transport::Sms.new
campaign.output    = Output::Plain.new
campaign.process
```

**Rule of thumb** (Sandi Metz):
- **Inherit** only for true "is-a" relationships with a stable type hierarchy.
- **Mixin** for cross-cutting "acts-as" concerns (`Closeable`, `Watchable`).
- **Compose** for flexible "uses-a" relationships — when you need runtime
  swappability or the behaviors vary independently.

If you're tempted to inherit just to reuse code, compose instead.

**When:** family of interchangeable behaviors (transports, formatters, storage
backends). The behaviors are independent and don't need deep access to the
host's internal state.
**When not:** simple `case` in a controller action that doesn't warrant the
abstraction. If the strategy needs half the model's attributes, you're adding
indirection for no gain (Feature Envy).

## `store_accessor` for JSON/JSONB Columns

Expose JSON column keys as first-class attributes with type coercion.
Avoids `properties["reactions"]` string-keyed access throughout the codebase.

```ruby
class Message < ApplicationRecord
  store_accessor :properties, :reactions, :responding_to, :tokens_count

  # Now accessed as:
  message.reactions        # instead of message.properties["reactions"]
  message.responding_to=   # instead of message.properties[:responding_to] =
end
```

**When:** a JSONB/JSON column has a known set of keys accessed in multiple places.
**When not:** the JSON structure is fully dynamic or schema-less.

## Presenters / Decorators

Add display logic to a model without polluting it. Keeps views and models clean.

<!-- Add your preferred approach here: Draper? Plain Ruby decorator? ViewComponent? -->

**When:** model methods start returning HTML, formatted strings, or view-specific logic.

## Policy Objects (Pundit)

Authorization rules live in policy objects, separate from models and controllers.
One policy per resource, named `<Model>Policy`.

```ruby
# app/policies/card_policy.rb
class CardPolicy < ApplicationPolicy
  def update?
    record.creator == user || user.admin?
  end

  def destroy?
    update?
  end

  class Scope < ApplicationPolicy::Scope
    def resolve
      scope.where(account: user.account)
    end
  end
end

# Controller
class CardsController < ApplicationController
  def update
    @card = Card.find(params[:id])
    authorize @card

    @card.update!(card_params)
  end

  def index
    @cards = policy_scope(Card)
  end
end
```

**When:** authorization logic is conditional, role-based, or duplicated across controllers.
**When not:** a simple `current_user.admin?` check in one place — inline is fine.
