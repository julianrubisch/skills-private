## Gem Selection Heuristics

> From `coding-classic.md`:

1. **Can vanilla Rails do this?** — ActiveRecord, ActionMailer, ActiveJob cover most needs
2. **Is it the app's core concern?** — if yes, own the code; if fringe, use a gem
3. **Does it add infrastructure?** — Redis? Database-backed alternatives exist
4. **Is the complexity worth it?** — 150 lines of custom code vs. a 10k-line gem
5. **Is it from someone you trust?** — 37signals, Shopify, Heartcombo gems are battle-tested
