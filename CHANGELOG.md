# Changelog

All notable changes to the public jr-rails-skills marketplace are documented
here. This changelog is used by `scripts/sync-public.sh` to populate GitHub
release notes on julianrubisch/skills.

## Unreleased

- Add "Type-Checking Dispatch" smell to smells.md with detection signals and
  decision table (concern vs presenter vs delegated_type)
- Extend refactoring 002 (Replace Conditional with Polymorphism) with
  "Where to Put the Extracted Behavior" section — two concrete shapes
  (controller→presenter, model→concern/delegated_type)
- Add "The Abstraction Ladder" to architecture.md Rule 2 — concise model→
  presenter→component→controller tier with "push it down" guidance
